<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a student doing my master's degree in Hong Kong. 
  Although I study business, I am interested in technology. 
  I taught myself python, java, html, etc. 
  It doesn't seem to be related to finding a job though haha. 
  I really like the scenery here, and I hope to try to stay.
</p>

<p>
  I love different cultures and I hope to travel someday. 
  So now I'm trying to learn Cantonese and English, and I hope to learn Japanese sometime. 
  I really like secondary culture and would like to be an artist (but only as an amateur).
</p>

<p>
  I have some other hobbies, such as violin (I have been practicing violin for more than 10 years), voice, and reading. 
  Of course, I seem to have a wide range of interests, and I always want to learn a lot of things, 
  so I am not very proficient in some things, for example, this website is very rough. 
  I know the real project can't be done like this, but I hope I can refine some of it in the future.

  I have a github and upload some simple thing there, In the case you are interested in it:
