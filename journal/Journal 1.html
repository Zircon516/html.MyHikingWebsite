        HI, it is my first journal
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't know what to say. but just a liitle bit upset. 
        This website is simple and of course not good enough for me to find a job.
        Yesterday I know a girl whose name is Fecilia Chen, 
        she is great, she learned DMD in Pennyflia University. 
        She draw well, and can use a lot coding languages. 
        I hope I can be like her one day. 
    </p>
    <p>
        She also build a website, a recipe website. I want do a website like that. 
        So I will keep on learning html,css and javascript, just or fun.
        After this holiday I will keep on looking for job,
        having time to design and build things is where i can abandon bad mode,
        thank u.
    </p>
